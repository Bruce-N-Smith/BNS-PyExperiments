# PyExperiments
Repo to hold some practical python files. 
First learning arena for me. 
First time using a permissive MIT License, tell me what I should know in the issues!

Had a couple of really stale tutorial repos that I deleted in 2022, left a bit of an activity gap in 2020-2021.

If you're new to coding, I'd recommend just downloading Visual Studio Code on your local machine, then you can run Python files locally to see them work.
